Minesweeper: A Game Of Deductive Logic

Game that generates a retnagular file full of spaces that either have amine or do not. The objective of the game is to reveal all the spaces without a mine. To do this you click on spaces. Spaces without a mine will tell you how many mines are adjacent to the empty space (diagnolly included).
